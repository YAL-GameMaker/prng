## Preparing to build

Needless to say, this requires basic familiarity with Visual Studio, Command Prompt/PowerShell, and Windows in general.

### Setting up GmxGen

1. [Install Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/) (make sure to install Neko VM!)
2. [Download the source code](https://github.com/YAL-GameMaker-Tools/GmxGen/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) 
(or [check out the git repository](https://github.com/YAL-GameMaker-Tools/GmxGen))
3. Compile the program: `haxe build.hxml`
4. Create an executable: `nekotools boot bin/GmxGen.n`
5. Copy `bin/GmxGen.exe` to a folder your PATH (e.g. to Haxe directory )

### Setting up GmlCppExtFuncs

1. (you should still have Haxe and Neko VM installed)
2. [Download the source code](https://github.com/YAL-GameMaker-Tools/GmlCppExtFuncs/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) 
(or [check out the git repository](https://github.com/YAL-GameMaker-Tools/GmlCppExtFuncs))
3. Compile the program: `haxe build.hxml`
4. Create an executable: `nekotools boot bin/GmlCppExtFuncs.n`
5. Copy `bin/GmlCppExtFuncs.exe` to a folder your PATH (e.g. to Haxe directory )

### Setting up Haxe libraries

1. (you should still have Haxe and Neko VM installed)
2. Install `sfgml`, a Haxe➜GML compiler: `haxelib git sfgml https://github.com/YAL-Haxe/sfgml.git`
3. Install `sfhx`, its dependency: `haxelib git sfhx https://github.com/YAL-Haxe/sfhx.git`

## Building the DLL extension

Open the `.sln` in Visual Studio (VS2019 was used as of writing this), compile for x86 - Release and then x64 - Release.

If you have correctly set up `GmxGen` and `GmlCppExtFuncs`,
the project will generate the `autogen.gml` files for GML<->C++ interop during pre-build
and will copy and [re-]link files during post-build.

## Building the GML scripts

Open a command prompt / terminal in the repository directory.

- Do `haxe build-all.hxml` to generate scripts for the test/benchmark project.
- Do `haxe build-gms2.hxml` to generate scripts for importing to your own projects.  
  They will show up in `export/gms2` folder.
